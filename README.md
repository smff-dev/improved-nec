# Improved NotEnoughCoins
This is mod is an Auction House flipping mod. It works similarly to NotEnoughCoins, but given they stopped updating the free version I took their code and improved it and added some features I thought were lacking as well as cleaned up the code.

It isn't as good as any paid mods but it aims to add some life into the discontinued scene of free flipping mods.
